		vpn-ct is a bash wrapper to control protonvpn-cli. 

		it requires protonvpn-cli, installed and configured

		This simple script should run without problems
		in any system with the GNU coreutils and
		the POSIX standards.

		repo: github.com/allwera/vpn-ct

		The script will pass the received instructions
		to the end of the "protonvpn-cli --" string,
		except for the letter Q, which quits, and for
		an empty input, which allows you to get the
		current VPN status by just pressing [Enter].

		You may therefore use any letter you want
		so long as it matches one of the options
		listed when you input H, calling the help
		dialog with the full set of options.

				[  Installation  ]

		If you are familiar with git, you can download the
		script in your current directory using the command:

			git clone https://github.com/allwera/vpn-ct
	
		You will get two directories, and if you are reading
		this far you probably want the en_US one. Inside is
		the vpn-ct file.

		You will need to grant execute permissions with chmod:

			chmod +x vpn-ct

		And now you can run the script:

			sudo bash vpn-ct

		If you want to execute it from any terminal,
		copy it to your bin folder:

			sudo cp vpn-ct /usr/bin/vpn-ct

		And you will be able to execute it with "sudo vpn-ct"
		
		If you are having issues executing, check the
		file permissions using ls -l and make sure you
		have the appropriate permissions.

				[  License  ]

		The code is available under the GNU GPL v.3.0.

		Bear in mind that this is just a simple script with
		NO WARRANTY and that there is NO affiliation whatsoever
		between the development of this wrapper and ProtonVPN AG,
		Proton Technologies AG, CERN or ProtonMail, to whom here
		is a thank you note for providing public VPN worldwide.
